Project Name: Sudoku Solver 

Description: Solves Sudoku puzzles

DevLog:
5/12/16 Sorato & Elina: wrote readMe.md and initialized master branch
-researched Sudoku Solver algorithms (backtrack and state space search) 
5/13/16 Sorato & Elina: started the Sudoku.java code, implemented general functions and vars 
5/16/16 Sorato & Elina: finished outline and some functions involved in solver() and solverH() 
-Started constructors 
5/17/16 Elina: fixed constructors and toString, added to Solver 
-Sorato: updated Sudoku.java and started solver
5/18/16 Sorato: updated solver code
-Sorato & Elina: updated Sudoku.java. Still working on solver
5/19/16 Elina: Fixed Solver
5/22/16 Sorato: started processing display, made grid, made interactive fxn
5/23/16 Sorato & Elina: Fixing the Sudoku.pde
Elina: Fixed clicking to add number on grid problem, fixed grid display, solve and reset buttons, implemented solver
Sorato: updated README.md, fixed minor bugs
5/27/16 Elina: Fixed the check if the grid was valid, so that two of the same numbers could not be placed together. Created error message
5/29/16 Elina: Reasearched algorithms to generate a sudoku puzzle
5/31/16 Elina: Began implementing a generator
6/1/16 Elina: Added the rest of the swaps into the generator to create different puzzles
6/2/16 Elina: Implemented swaps into the puzzle
6/3/16 Elina: Started the algorithm to delete cells from the grids, so puzzles can be generated
6/5/16 Elina: Finished the deleteCell() method, which allowed for a puzzle to be generated. Made the generator static so that it could be used in processing. Implemented difficulty in deleteCell()
6/6/16 Elina: Fixed error message to now give two options, either continue with or restart the input on the board. Worked on generator screen, which allows the person to interact and solve the puzzle themselve. Also fixed solver screen.
6/7/16 Elina: Fixed button interaction on title page. Updated readMe.md




=============================================================================================================================

Project plan/outline including your goals prioritized by importance and chronology (things to do + things already done):
1. Code sudoku solver/AI on java (May 19th)
2. Code simple sudoku interface on Processing (May 21st)
3. Implement solver in Processing (May 23rd)
4. Use image processing to import sudoku puzzles from screenshots, photos, etc. (June 7th)
